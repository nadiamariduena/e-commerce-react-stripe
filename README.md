## Creating products with Commerce.js

<br>

- This is the continuation of the fecthing-data-from-commercejs

<br>

#### As I was commenting in the previous branch, this are the steps to create a product:

[<img src="/src/img/creating__products_commercejs2.gif"/>]()

<br>

- SKU is a product identifier

- If you don't fill the **SKU**, its going to auto populate it.
- if you don't add **quantity** its going to say that you have unlimited amounts

#### Right now I have 3 products inside the commerce.js, i think its to do the changes in the cards, to display them in the browser, as we still have the fake ones inside the Products.jsx.

<br>

[<img src="/src/img/after_setting_a_product.gif"/>]()

<br>

<br>
<br>

## ü••

### To display the products we have to pass them as <u>PROPS</u> to our Products component

```javascript
  //
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar />
      <Products />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

#### Later most of the important things like the card, the products etc are going to be inside the App.js, right now they are in other folder, but soon it s going to change

<br>
<br>

# üêí

#### 1. So lets pass the Props

- INSIDE THE APP.JS

```javascript
// replace this:
<Products   />

// For this
<Products products={products} />
```

#### 2. After that: go to the Products.jsx and change the following

- delete the following

```javascript
const products = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Beauty stuff 001",
    description: "Cremes Random",
    price: "$5",
    image: "../img/photo-1580870069867-74c57ee1bb07.jpeg",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Beauty stuff 002",
    description: "Cremes Random",
    price: "$10",
    image: "../img/photo-1608142172654-318a624fe4ec.jpeg",
  },
];
```

#### 3. Add the props here too:

```javascript
const Products = ({ products }) => {
```

<br>

#### 4. Now go to the Product.jsx

- Use the div and the console log to get an outcome so that you can see something and use the inspector, as you really need to use the inspector to continue.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è

> You will get an error if you don't add the return:

```javascript
console.log(product);
//
return <div>test</div>;
```

#### Now lets visualize what we have, open the browser

- why did we use a console.log and a div?

- We did that to check which property we are going to use, as they are not the same (the properties at the right side of the inspector, are the ones that are going to guide you)

[<img src="/src/img/props_products2.jpg"/>]()

<br>
<br>

### Now lets go back to the Product.jsx

- CHANGE A COUPLE OF STUFF (**Use the inspector**)

- You can remove the **test div** and the console log at any time,(**But add it again if you get some errors when applying the parameter in the cards, like you will see in the image below**)

<br>

##### üî¥ IN the video tutorial there are many deprecated things, this one for example didnt work for me <u>product.image.source</u>, so i had to use the console log and the div test again to check the properties, once i did that i had this: image={product.image.filename}, but it worked for all but the images, yes i solved the error but still no image, so i removed the console log and the div return, and i checked again the properties, and this time i had this: image={product.image.url}

- Check the vid in your private videos (notes to myself)

- You will see there all about this issue

```javascript
// Change this:
<CardMedia
  className={classes.media}
  image={product.image.source}
  //
  //
  // For this:
  //  image={product.image.filename}
  image={product.image.url}
/>
```

<br>

### This is how the IMG should look like now:

```javascript
const Product = ({ product }) => {
  //  styles HOOK
  const classes = useStyles();

  //
  return (
    <>

      <Card className={classes.root}>

        {/* img */}
        <CardMedia
          className={classes.media}
          image={product.image.url}
          title={product.name}
        />
```

[<img src="/src/img/img_propertie_issue_solved.jpg"/>]()

## SUCCESS ‚úîÔ∏è | We can now display the products

<br>

### Now lets solve the Html Issue in the card, its displaying html elements

- Before i forget, i also had to change this as well

```javascript
// from this:
<Typography gutterBottom variant="h5">
  {product.price}
</Typography>
//
// to this
<Typography gutterBottom variant="h5">
{product.price.formatted_with_symbol}
</Typography>

```

<br>

### Now lets solve the html issue

- REPLACE the following:

```javascript
// Description in Product.jsx
//change this
<Typography variant="body2" color="textSecondary">
  {product.description}
</Typography>
//
// __html: product you need double underscore
// For this:
          <Typography
            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: product.description }}
            variant="body2"
            color="textSecondary"
          />

```

<br>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è

## dangerouslySetInnerHTML

- Dangerously Set innerHTML,

**Improper use of the innerHTML can open you up to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.** Sanitizing user input for display is notoriously error-prone, and failure to properly sanitize is one of the leading causes of web vulnerabilities on the internet.

Our design philosophy is that it should be "easy" to make things safe, and developers should explicitly state their intent when performing ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù operations. <u>The prop name dangerouslySetInnerHTML is intentionally chosen to be frightening, and the prop value (an object instead of a string) can be used to indicate sanitized data.</u>

After fully understanding the security ramifications and properly sanitizing the data, create a new object containing only the key \_\_html and your sanitized data as the value. Here is an example using the JSX syntax:

##### [Set innerHTML vs dangerouslySetInnerHTML](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37337289/react-js-set-innerhtml-vs-dangerouslysetinnerhtml)

> The immediate effect of using innerHTML versus dangerouslySetInnerHTML is identical -- the DOM node will update with the injected HTML.

> However, behind the scenes when you use dangerouslySetInnerHTML it lets React know that the HTML inside of that component is not something it cares about.

> Because React uses a virtual DOM, when it goes to compare the diff against the actual DOM, it can straight up bypass checking the children of that node because it knows the HTML is coming from another source. So there's performance gains.

### üî¥ IF YOU GET THIS ERROR (its probably because you have no internet connection)

##### Unhandled Rejection (TypeError): Cannot read property 'status' of undefined

- in your local server you can visualize almost anything but for online databases you do need an internet connection

# Make Cart clickable and the basket dynamic

- By making the CART clickable, **we will be able to add the item we click on, on the basket**(like when we really want to buy something)

<br>

### Inside the App.js

<br>

### üõí

#### Create the CART (this again, is done by commercejs)

<br>

- OUR CART is going to be another **state** in React
- More specifically, it's going to be an **object{}**

<br>

- By default that cart is going to be **empty**, because in the beginning there s no products in our basket/cart

```javascript
const App = () => {
  // 39:39
  const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);
  // by default our products are going to be equal to an empty Array ([])
  //
  //
  //HERE BELOW  53:10
  const [cart, setCart] = useState({});
  // By default that cart is going to be **empty**, because in the beginning there s no products in our basket/cart
```

 <br>

# Fetch

#### Now we are going to create another function "to see what is in the cart"

<br>

- This new **fetch** function is going to be again an **ASYNC AWAIT** function

- Inside of that function we can do the same thing we did with the first one also in the App.js

<br>

```javascript
const App = () => {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);
  //
  const [cart, setCart] = useState({});
  //
  // The fetch related to the products
  const fetchProducts = async () => {
    const { data } = await commerce.products.list();
    setProducts(data);
  };

  //
  // The fetch related to the CART
  const fetchCart = async () => {
    const response = await commerce.cart.retrieve();
    // so what we want do here? we want to fetch something
    // - we want to fetch a response* from await* to get the thing we want in this case: the cart: commerce.cart.retrieve();
  };
```

<br>

### Use the retrieve() call

- to retrieve individual records from an object. The client application passes the list of fields to retrieve, the object, and an array of record IDs to retrieve.

<br>

#### so our actual response, is the cart

```javascript
// The fetch related to the CART
const fetchCart = async () => {
  const cart = await commerce.cart.retrieve();
  // so what we want do here? we want to fetch something
  // - we want to fetch a response* in this case the cart from await*
  setCart(cart);
};
```

#### Lets change the data above to this format, as we are repeating outselves with the variables

```javascript
//  Change this:
const fetchCart = async () => {
  const cart = await commerce.cart.retrieve();
  setCart(cart);
};

// For this:
const fetchCart = async () => {
  // because you can use the value of the API to do the short way
  setCart(await commerce.cart.retrieve());
};
```

<br>

### Once the fetch function is done, lets oficially FETCH the cart by adding it to the useEffect()

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchProducts();
  //
  fetchCart();
}, []);
```

<br>

### Now lets console.log(cart) to see what is in there

<br>

- So what we have here: first we get an empty array then we have 2 products

 <br>

[<img src="/src/img/adding_the_cart1.jpg"/>]()

<br>

### But the thing we are looking for: Is 'line items' and the 'sub total'

[<img src="/src/img/adding_the_cart2_line_items_subtotal.jpg"/>]()

<br>
<br>

### So what we have until now:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
// KEY
import { commerce } from "./lib/commerce";
import { Navbar, Products } from "./components";

//
const App = () => {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);
  //
  //
  //
  const [cart, setCart] = useState({});
  //  // By default that cart is going to be **empty**, because in the beginning there s no products in our basket/cart
  //
  //
  // so what we want do here? we want to fetch something
  // - we want to fetch a response* from await*
  // - So we have to await something
  // - And that something is going to be a specific API call to this commerce instance
  // - its going to be as simple as commerce.products.list, and then you 'call it ()' as a function
  // - this is going to return a promise:  commerce.products.list(), so we have to await to see what is inside that promise
  const fetchProducts = async () => {
    const { data } = await commerce.products.list();

    setProducts(data);
  };

  //
  // The fetch related to the CART
  const fetchCart = async () => {
    const cart = await commerce.cart.retrieve();
    // so what we want do here? we want to fetch something
    // - we want to fetch a response* from await*
    setCart(cart);
  };
  //

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProducts();
    fetchCart();
    //
  }, []);
  //
  console.log(cart);
  //
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar />
      <Products products={products} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

<br>
<br>

# :shopping_cart: üçç

## Add the items (App.js)

### To add the items to the cart, we have to create another function

<br>

- This is going to be **the function the add products to the cart**
- Its going to be an **ASYNC** function, and its going to **accept 2 parameters**
- the first √ºaram is the **productId** and the second is the **quantity**
- So we are going to again get the **response** from the commerce.js

```javascript
const handleAddToCart = async (productId, quantity) => {
  // so what we want do here? we want to fetch something
  const response = await commerce.cart.add();
  // - we want to fetch a response* from await: commercejs*
  // so what are we going to add here in the parenthesis: cart.add();?
  // we are going to add the productId!
};
```

<br>

### So what are we going to add here in the parenthesis: cart.add();?

- we are going to add the **productId** !
- and also how many products, hence: **quantity**

```javascript
const handleAddToCart = async (productId, quantity) => {
  const response = await commerce.cart.add(productId, quantity);
  // So we are going to use this 2 params: (productId, quantity) to require data to the API commercejs
};
```

<br>

### Now change the <u>response</u> for <u>item</u>

```javascript
// change this:
const response = await
//
// for this:
const item = await

```

<br>

### update the cart

- So this is the cart **after** the cart has been **added**

```javascript
//
// update our cart **
setCart(item.cart);
//
//
```

<br>
<br>

# üñ±Ô∏è

### But where do we click? where do we use this function handleAddToCart?

- Inside the App.js we have no buttons, so we have to set it up inside the Products.jsx

#### üî¥

- **BUT BEFORE THAT**: we have to pass the handleAddToCart function to the products.jsx, and to do it we have to use **PROPS**

<br>

```javascript
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar />
      <Products products={products} onAddToCart={handleAddToCart} />
```

<br>
<br>

# üêí

# Products.jsx

### So now we know that our products is accepting an **onAddToCart** _prop_ inside the App.js

<br>

- **LETS PASS** it inside the **Products.jsx**

<br>

- **onAddToCart** is the function (from the App.js, **handleAddToCart**) that is going to add the item to our CART

```javascript
const Products = ({ products, onAddToCart }) => {
  //
```

### So where do we use it?, because we dont have any buttons?

- WE ARE GOING TO **PASS IT AGAIN**...**one level deeper**

<br>

- **AND TO DO SO:** we need to add it here(**remember we are still inside the Products.jsx**)

```javascript
// Now the onAddToCart that contains the handleAddToCart,  is ready to travel on level deeper to Product.jsx
<Product product={product} onAddToCart={onAddToCart} />
```

<br>

<br>

# üêøÔ∏è

# Product.jsx

- Pass the data from the function here below:

```javascript
 const Product = ({ product, onAddToCart }) => {
```

<br>

### So now what we have to do, is simply _CALL it_ in a button click

- pass the info below inside the icon button: {onAddToCart}

```javascript

        <CardActions disableSpacing className={classes.cardActions}>
          {/* ICON BUTTON ON CLICK */}
          <IconButton aria-label="Add to Cart" onClick={onAddToCart}>
            <AddShoppingCart />
          </IconButton>
        </CardActions>
      </Card>
    </>
  );
};
```

## üî¥

#### we forgot something, we dont want to call it like this:

- because its not going to know which product are we adding

```javascript
<IconButton aria-label="Add to Cart" onClick={onAddToCart}>

```

#### FOR THAT REASON, you will add the id, like in the code below:

<br>

# we have to make a callback function

- so that it doesnt call itself immediately: **onClick={()=>}**

- of course the function: onAddToCart()}

- Then we have to pass **2 parameters** remember: productId, quantity

- onClick={()=> onAddToCart(product.id, 1)}

- 1 corresponds to quantity

min 58:38

```javascript
<IconButton aria-label="Add to Cart" onClick={()=> onAddToCart(product.id, 1)}

```

<br>

#### As the product.id is the content below, so its the only thing that is going to differenciate it from all other products, it works just like the key when mapping images.

- the below content is a single product

```javascript
       <CardMedia
          className={classes.media}
          image={product.image.url}
          title={product.name}
        />

        <CardContent>
          <div className={classes.cardContent}>
            {/* name */}
            <Typography gutterBottom variant="h5">
              {product.name}
            </Typography>
            {/* price */}
            <Typography gutterBottom variant="h5">
              {product.price.formatted_with_symbol}
            </Typography>
          </div>
          {/*


          Description */}
          <Typography
            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: product.description }}
            variant="body2"
            color="textSecondary"
          />
        </CardContent>
        {/*

        CardActions  */}
        <CardActions disableSpacing className={classes.cardActions}>
          {/* ICON BUTTON ON CLICK */}
          <IconButton
            aria-label="Add to Cart"
            onClick={() => onAddToCart(product.id, 1)}
          >
            <AddShoppingCart />
          </IconButton>
        </CardActions>
```

## THE QUANTITY

- Its always going to be **1)}**, as we add items 1 by 1

<br>
<br>

### So lets test it in the console (ignore the red basket as its still static)

- The reason why i have more than 1 item inside the line_items:3, is because i ve clicked few times before. I am more than sure that we are going to create a button to remove items from the car and so this section will be cleaned.

[<img src="/src/img/basket_cart_adding_items-to.cart.gif"/>]()

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

# üå¥

## THE ICON INSIDE THE NAVBAR

min 59:50

- Right now we have just an static icon telling us, that there s something inside the basket

<br>

- We are going to remove that and make the connection between the icon inside the navbar and the information inside the app.js, information that is related to the add the item to cart.

<br>

### Go to the App.js

- Pass the following informations as PROPS

```javascript
// This is going to simply be a number of items in the cart
<Navbar totalItems={cart.total_items} />
```

<br>

## Now go to the NAVBAR and pass the Prop there

##### 1.

```javascript
const Navbar = ({ totalItems }) => {
```

##### 2.

```javascript
// REPLACE THIS
   <Badge badgeContent={2} color="secondary">
  // FOR THIS
     <Badge badgeContent={totalItems} color="secondary">
```

<br>

- So one think to notice is that our cart is not going to be empty after we click add a product, its going to remain there

<br>

[<img src="/src/img/finally_adding_items_to_the_basket.gif"/>]()


### Now we have to create the layout for the cart

- It will be the page where the user will be redirected to see the products in the basket
