# CREDITS:

Big thanks to **[Adrian Hajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin)** , for sharing this **Great tutorial** on how to set up an E-commerce store using: React | Commerce.js and Stripe.


>**NOTE** THE TEACHER tells that if we are using PROPS too much, the solution for it, is React Context

- But he is not going to use it in this project because we dont have many functions.

- I will create a recap react context soon (based in my school lessons)

  // For each country, what we wanna do? we want to return,
  // a block of JSX, in this case it will be:<MenuItem and its content
-->

<br>

- This is the continuation of **token-shipping-Subdivisions**, is still related to the Checkout button

# Countries/ Shipping Options

2:27:50

#### What we will do in this phase, is more or less repeat <u>what we did when creating the shipping subdivisions</u>, but there are a couple of things that are going to be different.

- First step will be to **FETCH** the options from the **commerce.**

<br>

- This **fetchShippingOptions** is going to accept a few things **async()**

<br>

- **checkoutTokenId, country, region = null**, we can set the region to be equal to **null**, in case there is none.

<br>

- So now that we have that, **we will be fetching the Options**: const options = await **commerce.checkout.**...

<br>

- The **checkout.** is coming from the **Checkout.jsx** line 37

<br>

- Here you specify the country you are and the region: **{country, region }**, This is going to make sure to get a specific shipping option for this country and region

  <br>

- Now that we have these options, add the following:

```javascript
// plural
setShippingOptions(options); //this is an array
// individual
setShippingOption(options[0].id); //grabing the 1 from the array on top
```

<br>

```javascript
//
// FETCH OPTIONS 3
const fetchShippingOptions = async (
  checkoutTokenId,
  country,
  region = null
) => {
  const options = await commerce.checkout.getShippingOptions(checkoutTokenId, {
    country,
    region,
  });
  //
  //
  setShippingOptions(options);
  setShippingOption(options[0].id);

  //
};
//
```

<br>
<br>

<!-- [<img src="/src/img/token_subdivisions1-success.gif"/>]() -->

## Now the Question is, when do we get the Shipping Options?

- The answer is, we get them after we get the subdivisions, so we **first** we get the countries, then we get the **subdivisions** ,then we get the countries.

<br>

# üåû

# So we can use <u>ANOTHER</u> useEffect here:

<br>

- This new UseEffect is going to run after the **}, [shippingSubdivision]);** changes. so if you look at the **3 useEffect** we have now, the second one waits until the first one which is the country 'changes', the 3 one waits until the second one changes, (**all in an structured way, as we need the asnwers from the top, so that the below can work <u>depending of the answers</u>**)

<br>

```javascript
//
//1
// Countries
useEffect(() => {
  fetchShippingCountries(checkoutToken.id);
}, []);
//
//
// waits for no. 1
//Subdivisions
useEffect(() => {
  if (shippingCountry) fetchSubdivisions(shippingCountry);
}, [shippingCountry]);
//
//
//
//waits for no.2

// Options
useEffect(() => {
  if (shippingSubdivision)
    fetchShippingOptions(
      checkoutToken.Id,
      shippingCountry,
      shippingSubdivision
    );
}, [shippingSubdivision]);
//
//
```

<br>

## Explanation of the 3. useEffect (read the comments)

```javascript
//
// Options
useEffect(() => {
  //1 If shippingSubdivision exists, we want to fetch: fetchShippingOptions
  if (shippingSubdivision)
    //2   We want to pass: checkoutToken.Id which is coming from Props,
    //  The **checkoutToken.Id** is coming from the **Checkout.jsx** line 37
    fetchShippingOptions(
      checkoutToken.Id,
      shippingCountry,
      //3 Then we want to pass the ShippingCountry which is coming from our 'states' line 25 AddressForm.jsx
      //
      shippingSubdivision
    );
  // 4 finally we have to loop over it
}, [shippingSubdivision]);
//
//
```

<br>

### Now that the UseEffect is ready, we have to move to the top and Loop over it. BUT WHY arent we converting it with Object.entries, like we did for the countries and subdivisions?

<br>

##### THE REASON: its because 'ShippingOptions' are an array by default.

```javascript
// OPTIONS ***
const options = shippingOptions.map(() => {
  //
  //      HERE  **
  //
});
```

<br>

- To see it more clearly, you can console.log the **options**

<br>

##### Hide the options

```javascript
//
// OPTIONS ***
// const options = shippingOptions.map(() => {

// });
//
console.log(shippingOptions);
//
```

> Result: You will have a couple of arrays, with lots of options and of course the fields related to the shipping options depending on the country
