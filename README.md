# CREDITS:

Big thanks to **[Adrian Hajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin)** , for sharing this **Great tutorial** on how to set up an E-commerce store using: React | Commerce.js and Stripe.


>**NOTE** THE TEACHER tells that if we are using PROPS too much, the solution for it, is React Context

- But he is not going to use it in this project because we dont have many functions.

- I will create a recap react context soon (based in my school lessons)

  // For each country, what we wanna do? we want to return,
  // a block of JSX, in this case it will be:<MenuItem and its content

- This is the continuation of **stripe-1**, is still related to the Checkout button

# CHECKOUT: / STRIPE 2

2:55:02

<br>
<br>

### Now Everything is ready to make the connection with stripe, so lets make account there.

1.  Open an account [STRIPE](https://stripe.com/en-de)

<br>

2. Once you got verified, click on the developers

[<img src="/src/img/developers-stripe.jpg"/>]()

<br>

3. Look for API keys **(in the left side column)**

[<img src="/src/img/developers-stripe_api.jpg"/>]()

## 4. grab the API key that says: Publishable key (the code)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è You should never ever Publish this type of sensitive data (keys) or the data that is inside the .env folder, thats why i decided to make this repository private until the project was ready, so that i could replace the sensitive data that i already "commited to git".

- You can either hide the repo and publish just the code **(without the keys of course)** but by doing that you will lose all the commitments.

<br>

#### [Should I add .env to .gitignore?](https://salferrarello.com/add-env-to-gitignore/)

- Yes there is a **way to replace it but it s hard, in case you already pushed in several branches**, it s easier to just create a new shop in commercejs and stripe to obtain **new keys** to use in a new repo (**of course you will have to delete the old shop so to make the old keys obsolete**)

<br>
<br>

<br>

### Now that we have the key, we are not going to add it here below:

- Because as we said, **its sensitive data**

```javascript
// PaymentForm.jsx
//
//STRIPE 2
const stripePromise = loadStripe("...");
```

<br>

### We are going to add the key inside the .env

```javascript
// what we already have / related to commercejs
REACT_APP_CHEC_PUBLIC_KEY = pk_veryLongcodeeeee;
// related to stripe
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = pk_verylongcodeee;
```

### After you do that

- CLOSE THE TERMINAL /strg+c
- and relaunch it /npm start

### Now copy the variable related to stripes

> REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY

### And paste it here:

```javascript
// replace this
//
//STRIPE 2
const stripePromise = loadStripe("...");
//
// for this
const stripePromise = loadStripe(process.env.REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY);
```

<br>

### Now that we connected stripe to our project, we can finally create that handleSubmit function

<br>

## üåû

#### This is going to be the finally function that finalizes the ORDER

```javascript
//
const PaymentForm = ({ checkoutToken, backStep }) => {
  //
  //
  const handleSubmit = () => {


  };

  return (
```

<br>

#### But where are we calling this function?

- We are calling it **inside the form**
- inside the form function handleSubmit={e, 1, 2}, we need to **pass 3 parameters**

```javascript
<form onSubmit={(e) => handleSubmit(e, elements, stripe)}>
```

<br>

### Pass them also inside the matrix function handleSubmit

- He added event instead of e, lets see if this causes issues :)

```javascript
const PaymentForm = ({ checkoutToken, backStep }) => {
  //
  //
  const handleSubmit = (event, elements, stripe) => {


  };

  return (
```

<br>

### add the event.preventDefault();

- This is going to make sure our website **dont refresh after we click the button**

<br>

#### NEXT: lets add some error handling

```javascript
const PaymentForm = ({ checkoutToken, backStep }) => {
  //
  //
  const handleSubmit = (event, elements, stripe) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    //
    //
    // If no stripe or no elements, then return, we are going outside and not doing anything
    // Stripe cannot do anything if we dont have this 2 things
    if (!stripe || !elements) return; //ERROR HANDLING
    //
    // the cardElement is coming from @stripe/react-stripe-js on top in the imports
    const cardElement = elements.getElement(CardElement);
    //
  };
```

<br>
<br>

## Now we are going to use 'stripes' API to create a payment method

- the **card: cardElement** variable makes reference to the card we just created: const cardElement = elements.getElement(CardElement);

```javascript
const PaymentForm = ({ checkoutToken, backStep }) => {
  //
  //
  const handleSubmit = async (event, elements, stripe) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    //
    //
    // If no stripe or no elements, then return, we are going outside and not doing anything
    // Stripe cannot do anything if we dont have this 2 things
    if (!stripe || !elements) return;
    //
    // the cardElement is coming from @stripe/react-stripe-js on top in the imports
    const cardElement = elements.getElement(CardElement);
    //
    //
// Now we are going to use 'stripes' API to create a payment method
    const { error, paymentMethod } = await stripe.createPaymentMethod({
      type: "card",
      card: cardElement,
    });
    //
    //
  };
```

### At this point you will have an error, and it s due to the async that we forgot to add here:

> const handleSubmit = async (event, elements, stripe) => {

<br>
<br>

## Now that we have the error and the payment method:

```javascript
// error
if (!stripe || !elements) return;
//
// payment method
const { error, paymentMethod } = await stripe.createPaymentMethod({
  type: "card",
  card: cardElement, //this is linked to the line above
});
```

<br>

### We can do an 'if else 'check
