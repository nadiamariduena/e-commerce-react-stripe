# CREDITS:

Big thanks to **[Adrian Hajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin)** , for sharing this **Great tutorial** on how to set up an E-commerce store using: React | Commerce.js and Stripe.


>**NOTE** THE TEACHER tells that if we are using PROPS too much, the solution for it, is React Context

- But he is not going to use it in this project because we dont have many functions.

- I will create a recap react context soon (based in my school lessons)

  // For each country, what we wanna do? we want to return,
  // a block of JSX, in this case it will be:<MenuItem and its content
-->

<br>

- This is the continuation of **token-shipping-Options**, is still related to the Checkout button

# FORM / THE NEXT BUTTON

2:35:23

- At this point the first part of the checkout is fully functional, the next step will be to add the **next button** and after that we will finally check the **payments details**.

<br>

#### Inside the AddressForm.jsx

- This are the only styles we will add in this way, as the teacher didnt want to create another **styles.js** file.

<br>

- I added a margin of 20px, inside the div that is nesting the 2 buttons.

<br>

```javascript
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
//
//
<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "space-between",
    marginTop: "20px",
  }}
>
  <Button component={Link} to="/cart" variant="outlined">
    Back to Cart
  </Button>
  {/* blue button */}
  <Button type="submit" variant="contained" color="primary">
    Next
  </Button>
</div>;
```

<br>
<br>

### Right now the only button that is going to work is: Back to Cart

<br>

## So lets work in the functionality of the 'next' button

<br>

- If you notice, in our Form, the <u>On submit </u>is empty

<br>

```javascript
// AddressForm.jsx
//

        <form onSubmit="">
```

<br>

### To use this onSubmit, we need to create a new function but inside the Checkout.jsx

- we are going to pass this function as **PROPS** to our AddressForm.jsx

<br>

- Of course the function is **going to accept the '(data)'**

<br>

```javascript
// we are going to pass this function
//  as PROPS to our AddressForm.jsx
// Of course the function is going to accept the 'data'
// So what are we going to do with that 'data
const next = (data) => {};
```

#### So what are we going to do with that 'data ?

<br>

##### We are going to **set** it to the shipping data right here:

- Create a new state

```javascript
// Checkout.jsx
//
// All the shipping data(countries,subDivs,options) will pass through this below
const [shippingData, setShippingData] = useState({});
// the useState in the beginning is going to be an empty object
//
```

<br>

### So once we have the shipping 'data' what we have to do to get that data 'populated'?

- Simply say: **setShippingData(data)**, and then we use that data that we passed here: **const next = (data) => {};**

<br>

```javascript
const next = (data) => {
  setShippingData(data);
};
```

<br>

## Of course after we 'set the shipping data', we want to move the 'setActiveStep' by one further, so just about the next function, we are going to create 2 new functions:

```javascript
// what we have right now
const [activeStep, setActiveStep] = useState(0);
```

<br>

- One function is going to be call: const **nextStep** and that function is going to  <u>setActiveStep</u> to step + 1

```javascript
// what we have right now
const [activeStep, setActiveStep] = useState(0);
```
