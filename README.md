# CREDITS:

Big thanks to **[Adrian Hajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin)** , for sharing this **Great tutorial** on how to set up an E-commerce store using: React | Commerce.js and Stripe.


>**NOTE** THE TEACHER tells that if we are using PROPS too much, the solution for it, is React Context

- But he is not going to use it in this project because we dont have many functions.

- I will create a recap react context soon (based in my school lessons)

- 1. default-project
- 2. navbar-basic-and-default-commercejs-setup
- 3. fecthing-data-from-commercejs
- 4. creating-products-with-commercejs-adding-dynamic-button-add-to-basket
- 5. Cart.CartItem-buttons-increase-decrease-remove
- 6. buttons-increase-decrease-remove-emptyCart-allready
- 7. checkoutTokenId-part1
- 8. token-countries-dropdown-1



  // For each country, what we wanna do? we want to return,
  // a block of JSX, in this case it will be:<MenuItem and its content
-->

<br>

- This is the continuation of **token-countries-dropdown-1**, is still related to the Checkout button

# Countries Subdivisions

2:23:02

#### What we will do in this phase, is to repeat what we did when creating the countries

- First step will be to **FETCH** the subdivisions, (_now you understand why we needed to have the countries first before having the subdivisions_)

<br>

```javascript
//
// FETCH SUBDIVISIONS
// SO THIS async function is going to accept 1 param, and that param is
// is going to be a : countryCode
// (_now you understand why we needed to have the countries first before having the subdivisions_)
const fetchSubdivisions = async (countryCode) => {
  // So we are going to be fecthing subdivisions for 1 specific country:
  const { subdivisions } = await commerce.services.loca;
  leListSubdivisions(countryCode);
  // make sure to put it as plural üëç
  setShippingSubdivisions(subdivisions);
  //1 we get the keys out of the subdivisions with the help of the: Object.keys
  //   singular subdivision üëç
  setShippingSubdivision(Object.keys(subdivisions)[0]); //2 and then we get the first element [0])
};
```
