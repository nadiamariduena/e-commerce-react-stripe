# CREDITS:

Big thanks to **[Adrian Hajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin)** , for sharing this **Great tutorial** on how to set up an E-commerce store using: React | Commerce.js and Stripe.


>**NOTE** THE TEACHER tells that if we are using PROPS too much, the solution for it, is React Context

- But he is not going to use it in this project because we dont have many functions.

- I will create a recap react context soon (based in my school lessons)

### Now that everything is ready, we can focus on the functionality of payments

- In this phase we will concentrate in payments(**stripe**)
- creating the layout for the form

# ü•• <u>CHECKOUT </u> set up

> The CheckoutForm layout will serve as some walk through as we go through the purchasing process

<br>

### To start with the _Checkout_ button, we have to go back to the Cart.js

<br>

- Once there add a **link** component to the **check out button** (we haven't created the route yet)

```javascript
<Button
  component={Link}
  to="/checkout" //*** Here ***
  className={classes.checkoutButton}
  size="large"
  type="button"
  variant="contained"
  color="primary"
>
  Checkout
</Button>
```

<br>

### To Create the 'checkout' route, go to the App.js

- Add the following:

```javascript
<Route exact path="/checkout">
  <Checkout /> //We still dont have it, and that is going to be the next step
</Route>
```

<br>

#### Even if we don't have the < Checkout /> component add it anyway, then export it inside the index.js

```javascript
// App.js
import { Products, Navbar, Cart, Checkout } from "./components";
//
// index.js *****
export { default as Checkout } from "./CheckoutForm/Checkout/Checkout";
```

<br>

## Create the <u>Checkout</u> component

- Go to the **components folder** and create a new folder

- call it **CheckoutForm**, inside of this folder **create another folder**

- call it **Checkout**, inside of this folder create a new file, call it **Checkout.jsx** (dont forget to export it inside the index.js)

<br>

# ü••

### Now export it (so to be used inside the route)

```javascript
export { default as Checkout } from "./CheckoutForm/Checkout/Checkout";
```

<br>
<br>

## <u>Checkout.jsx</u>

- This is the basic set up, I also added the **styles.js**, which can create a lot of undesired errors when we just set this file up.

<br>

- The **styles.js** goes inside the **Checkout folder**

<br>

```javascript
import React from "react";
//
import {
  CssBaseline,
  Paper,
  Stepper,
  Step,
  StepLabel,
  Typography,
  CircularProgress,
  Divider,
  Button,
} from "@material-ui/core";
//
//
import useStyles from "./styles";

//
//
const Checkout = () => {
  //
  const classes = useStyles();
  //
  return (
    <>
      <div></div>
    </>
  );
};

export default Checkout;
```

<br>
<br>

# STEPPER COMPONENT

> **Steppers convey progress through numbered steps.**

<br>

**Steppers display progress through a sequence of logical and numbered steps.** They may also be used for navigation. Steppers may display a transient feedback message after a step is saved.

<br>

[<img src="/src/img/stepper1.jpg"/>]()

<br>

### Other type of steppers

- **Definition: An input stepper is a two-segment UI control used to incrementally increase or decrease a numeric value.** Most input steppers are visual elements of a graphical user interface (i.e., they're GUI controls), voice and gestural interfaces can also have steppers.

[<img src="/src/img/stepper2.png"/>]()

<br>

### Adding a stepper

> The stepper is a component
> that moves as you move through the steps.

**stepper needs to have a couple of things:**

- it needs an activeStep, we don't have it yet, so will set it
  to 0 , **activeStep={0}**. Later on we will update this using state.

```javascript
<Stepper activeStep={0} className={classes.stepper}>
```

<br>

- Inside the stepper we have to **.map** through all our steps,
  and the steps to map on will be:

- **shipping address** and **payment details**

```javascript
const steps = ["Shipping address", "Payment details"];
```

<br>
<br>

## What we have until now:

<br>

```javascript
import useStyles from "./styles";
//
//
// Stepper 2.
const steps = ["Shipping address", "Payment details"];

//
//

const Checkout = () => {
  //
  const classes = useStyles();
  //
  return (
    <>
      <div className={classes.toolbar} /> //this div is a padding for the navbar
      <main className={classes.layout}>
        <Paper className={classes.paper}>
          <Typography variant="h4" align="center">
            Checkout
          </Typography>
          {/*  1. */}
          <Stepper activeStep={0} className={classes.stepper}>
            {/*  3. */}
            {steps.map((step) => (
              <Step key={step}>
                <StepLabel>{step}</StepLabel>
              </Step>
            ))}
          </Stepper>
        </Paper>
      </main>
    </>
  );
};

export default Checkout;
```

### So this is going to generate a nice looking stepper

```javascript
<Stepper activeStep={0} className={classes.stepper}>
  {steps.map((step) => (
    <Step key={step}>
      <StepLabel>{step}</StepLabel>
    </Step>
  ))}
</Stepper>
```

<br>

1:43:00

### Now lets import the { useState}, so that we can actually traverse through the steps

```javascript
// 1
import React, { useState } from "react";
//
//
//
const Checkout = () => {
  //2
  const [activeStep, setActiveStep] = useState(0);
  //
//
// 3
//  Now the the active step is ready to be used, so change the following:
// instead of this:
 <Stepper activeStep={0} className={classes.stepper}>
 </Stepper>
//  add this
 <Stepper activeStep={activeStep} className={classes.stepper}>
//  WE CHANGED THE 0for the actual step
  </Stepper>
```

<br>

## Its working!

- So as you can see we have a nice < Paper > in the middle of the screen and inside of it we have the Stepper

[<img src="/src/img/checkout1_working.gif"/>]()

1:45:11

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Now we have to implement the different steps of the Form, as we said, we have the Address form, the payment form and finally the view of the order.

# üêí

- **Lets start by rendering** 2 different component below the < Stepper >, **depending in which step we are**

<br>

### Best way to do that is by implementing IF STATEMENTS

- We will use 2 for now to declare 3 components "we dont yet have"

<br>

### a. THE FORM function

- this form will **nest the 2 components** steps

```javascript
// step 1
// SO if we are currently in the step === 0
// then we are going to show: <AddressForm />
//  But if we are not in the 1. step,  : We are going to render the  <PaymentForm />
const Form = () => (activeStep === 0 ? <AddressForm /> : <PaymentForm />);
```

<br>
<br>

### b.

- This means

```javascript
{
  // 2. if activeStep is === to steps.length(meaning the last step)
  // 3. then we are going to show another (NEW component) which is <Confirmation />
  // At this point we have 3 new components, we have the <AddressForm /> and the  <PaymentForm />
  // 4. so if we are done with steps.length(last phase), we show confirmation, else : show  <Form />;
  activeStep === steps.length ? <Confirmation /> : <Form />;
  //
  //
  // this form from the above line <Form />, makes allusion to this:
  // const Form = () => (activeStep === 0 ? <AddressForm /> : <PaymentForm />);
}
```

<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>

1:47:46

## Now lets create the Forms of the 3 components

- < AddressForm />
- < PaymentForm />
- < Confirmation />

<br>
<br>

# üí∞

# PaymentForm and AddressForm

- This is the basic layout, you need it to visualize it inside the Checkout.jsx

<br>

```javascript
// PaymentForm
import React from "react";

const PaymentForm = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <div>Payment Form</div>
    </>
  );
};

export default PaymentFrom;

//
// AddressForm
import React from "react";

const AddressForm = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <div>Address Form</div>
    </>
  );
};

export default AddressForm;
```

<br>

## Import these 2 inside the Checkout.jsx

```javascript
import AddressForm from "../AddressForm";
import PaymentForm from "../PaymentForm";
```

#### As for the confirmation component, for now its going to be inside the Checkout.jsx, later on we will create perhaps a formal component.

<br>

- Lets create the component

```javascript
const Confirmation = () => <div>Confirmation</div>;
```

<br>

## Before testing: this is what we have until now:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import {
  CssBaseline,
  Paper,
  Stepper,
  Step,
  StepLabel,
  Typography,
  CircularProgress,
  Divider,
  Button,
} from "@material-ui/core";
//
//
import useStyles from "./styles";
//
import AddressForm from "../AddressForm";
import PaymentForm from "../PaymentForm";
//
// Stepper 2.
const steps = ["Shipping address", "Payment details"];

//
//

const Checkout = () => {
  //
  const [activeStep, setActiveStep] = useState(0);
  const classes = useStyles();
  //
  //
  //
  const Confirmation = () => <div>Confirmation</div>;
  //
  //
  const Form = () => (activeStep === 0 ? <AddressForm /> : <PaymentForm />);
  //
  //
  //
  return (
    <>
      <div className={classes.toolbar} />
      <main className={classes.layout}>
        <Paper className={classes.paper}>
          <Typography variant="h4" align="center">
            Checkout
          </Typography>

          <Stepper activeStep={activeStep} className={classes.stepper}>
            {/* stepper 3. */}
            {steps.map((step) => (
              <Step key={step}>
                <StepLabel>{step}</StepLabel>
              </Step>
            ))}
          </Stepper>
          {/*  */}

          {activeStep === steps.length ? <Confirmation /> : <Form />}
        </Paper>
      </main>
    </>
  );
};

export default Checkout;
```

<br>

[<img src="/src/img/checkout2_working.gif"/>]()

1:49:11

<br>
<br>

### At this point we cannot navigate through the steps because we still dont have the buttons for updating <u>setActiveStep</u>

```javascript
const [activeStep, setActiveStep] = useState(0);
```

#### But if you are really curious, you can do it manually:

```javascript
// If you change the 0 for 1, you will be able to see the paymente component
const [activeStep, setActiveStep] = useState(1);
```

<br>

1:49:42

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

# üçå

### Now we have to implement the forms one by one, We will start with the <u>AddressForm.jsx</u>

- Our form is going to have a lot of different fields, such as: name, lastname, address. city, zip code, country etc...

> Usually **we need to have many different states for every specific field** (as they need to be updated), that's why we will be using **[React Hook Forms](https://react-hook-form.com/)**

- In the link : **[React Hook Forms](https://react-hook-form.com/)** , You can see the difference between the rerenders of each option.

<br>
<br>

### What is a react hook form?

> React-hook-form is a library that helps you validate forms in React. React-hook-form is a minimal library without any other dependencies. It is performant and straightforward to use, requiring developers to write fewer lines of code than other form libraries.

<br>

## Lets start by importing some things:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import {
  InputLabel,
  Select,
  MenuItem,
  Button,
  Grid,
  Typography,
} from "@material-ui/core";
import { useForm, FormProvider } from "react-hook-form";

//
//
const AddressForm = () => {
  //
  //
  const methods = useForm();
  //
  return (
    <>
      <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>
        Shipping Address
      </Typography>
    </>
  );
};

export default AddressForm;
```

<br>

#### Next: we will be using the FORM from the react-hook-form

```javascript
<Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>
  Shipping Address
</Typography>;
{
  /* FORM */
}
<FormProvider></FormProvider>;
```

#### In the form we are going to spread all the methods from the hook : {...methods}

```javascript
<FormProvider {...methods}></FormProvider>
```

#### the form is going to have a 'on submit', that we will leave empty 'for now'.

```javascript
<form onSubmit={}></form>
```

#### The grid is going to be there to separate each our input fields

- The Grid is going to be of 'type' **container**.

- And its going to have a spacing of {3}

```javascript
<form onSubmit={}>
  <Grid container spacing={3}></Grid>
</form>
```

#### Inside of the Grids, we are going to have a special material UI field

- We have to find a way to connect material ui with the form hook

<br>
<br>
<br>

## üî¥ we are going to have this error because we didnt set up a value here:

> <form onSubmit={}> **but dont worry**, we will solve it later. if you dont want to see the error add something like 0

```javascript
27 |
  {
    /* FORM */
  };
28 |
(
  <FormProvider {...methods}>
    > 29 |{" "}
    <form onSubmit={}>
      | ^ 30 | <Grid container spacing={3}></Grid>
      31 |{" "}
    </form>
    32 |{" "}
  </FormProvider>
);
```

### Create 1 more component inside the Checkout Form

- call it **CustomTextField.jsx**

```javascript
import React from "react";

const CustomTextField = () => {
  return <div></div>;
};

export default CustomTextField;
```

<br>

- Inside of it import the following:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useFormContext, Controller } from "react-hook-form";
import { TextField, Grid } from "@material-ui/core";

const CustomTextField = () => {
  return <div></div>;
};

export default CustomTextField;
```

<br>

### Then add the Grid items

- The required={required} is going to grab things from props (we dont have them yet)

- **READ THE COMMENTS**

```javascript
const CustomTextField = () => {
  //
  //
  //this control comes from the useFormContext(); dependency
  const { control } = useFormContext();
  //
  //
  return (
    //   xs means that it will only have one item in mobile devices
    <Grid item xs={12} sm={6}>
      <Controller
        as={TextField}
        name={name} //we are going to get that through PROPS as we dont have it yet
        control={control}
        label={label} //we are also going to get that through props
        fullWidth //each of the articles will have a full grid
        required={required} //then we have to know if the field is required(also coming from props)
        error={isError}
      />
    </Grid>
  );
};
```

<br>

#### 1:55:42

#### Pass the following through PROPS (you have to still create them but pass it anyway)

```javascript
const CustomTextField = ({ name, label, required }) => {
```

## üî¥

#### Change the name of the component

- instead of CustomTextField

- add: **FormInput**

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

### Now import all the data we just created to the AddressForm.jsx

```javascript
import FormInput from "./FormInput";
```

#### Now we are going to see how powerful this is, and how many lines of code we save by just using this method

```javascript
<FormProvider {...methods}>
  <form onSubmit={0}>
    <Grid container spacing={3}>
      // //*** HERE *** //
    </Grid>
  </form>
</FormProvider>
```

<br>
<br>

#### Inside of the Grid we will pass all the information we need for the form

- We dont have to worry about value
- We dont have to manage the State

##### the only thing we need is this:

```javascript
<FormInput required name="firstName" label="First name" />
```

<br>
<br>

## üî¥ Errors

1:57:00

```javascript
Failed to compile.

src/components/CheckoutForm/FormInput.jsx
  Line 9:23:   'useFormContext' is not defined  no-undef
  Line 14:6:   'Grid' is not defined            react/jsx-no-undef
  Line 22:16:  'isError' is not defined         no-undef

Search for the keywords to learn more about each error.
```

### Most of the errors in that phase were related to:

- Not naming correctly the functions or naming them differently to what is shown in the video tutorial.

##### this is the [official repo of the project](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_e_commerce/blob/main/src/components/CheckoutForm/CustomTextField.jsx) , where you can spot the differences.

<br>

- Another reason for errors: changes or updates in the form dependency

<br>

#### So here is the code BEFORE AND AFTER the changes (check also the import)

<br>

## BEFORE

```javascript
// before
import { TextField } from "@material-ui/core";
import React from "react";
import { Controller, useForm } from "react-hook-form";

const FormInput = ({ name, label, required }) => {
  //
  //
  //this control comes from the useFormContext(); dependency
  const { control } = useFormContext();
  //
  //
  return (
    //   xs means that it will only have one item in mobile devices
    <Grid item xs={12} sm={6}>
      <Controller
        as={TextField}
        name={name}
        control={control}
        label={label}
        fullWidth
        required={required}
        error={isError}
      />
    </Grid>
  );
};

export default FormInput;
```

<br>

### AFTER

```javascript
import React from "react";
//
import { TextField, Grid, InputLabel } from "@material-ui/core";
import { useFormContext, Controller } from "react-hook-form";

const FormInput = ({ name, label, required }) => {
  //
  //
  //this control comes from the useFormContext(); dependency
  const { control } = useFormContext();
  const isError = false;
  //
  //
  return (
    //   xs means that it will only have one item in mobile devices
    <Grid item xs={12} sm={6}>
      <InputLabel>{label}</InputLabel>
      <Controller
        render={({ field }) => <TextField {...field} />}
        name={name}
        control={control}
        label={label}
        fullWidth
        required={required}
        error={isError}
        variant="outlined"
      />
    </Grid>
  );
};

export default FormInput;
```
<br>
