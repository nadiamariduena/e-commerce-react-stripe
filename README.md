# CREDITS:

Big thanks to **[Adrian Hajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin)** , for sharing this **Great tutorial** on how to set up an E-commerce store using: React | Commerce.js and Stripe.


>**NOTE** THE TEACHER tells that if we are using PROPS too much, the solution for it, is React Context

- But he is not going to use it in this project because we dont have many functions.

- I will create a recap react context soon (based in my school lessons)

- 1. default-project
- 2. navbar-basic-and-default-commercejs-setup
- 3. fecthing-data-from-commercejs
- 4. creating-products-with-commercejs-adding-dynamic-button-add-to-basket
- 5. Cart.CartItem-buttons-increase-decrease-remove
- 6. buttons-increase-decrease-remove-emptyCart-allready
- 7. checkoutTokenId-part1

-->

<br>

- This is the continuation of **token-countries-dropdown-1**, is still related to the Checkout button
