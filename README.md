## Creating products with Commerce.js

<br>

- This is the continuation of the fecthing-data-from-commercejs

<br>

#### As I was commenting in the previous branch, this are the steps to create a product:

[<img src="/src/img/creating__products_commercejs2.gif"/>]()

<br>

- SKU is a product identifier

- If you don't fill the **SKU**, its going to auto populate it.
- if you don't add **quantity** its going to say that you have unlimited amounts

<br>

<br>

#### Right now I have 3 products inside the commerce.js, i think it time to set up the functions to display them in the browser, as we still have the fake ones inside the Products.jsx.

<br>
<br>

## ü••

### To display the products we have to pass them as <u>PROPS</u> to our Products component

```javascript
  //
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar />
      <Products />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

#### Later most of the important things like the card, the products etc are going to be inside the App.js, right now they are in other folder, but soon it s going to change

<br>
<br>

# üêí

#### 1. So lets pass the Props

- INSIDE THE APP.JS

```javascript
// replace this:
<Products   />

// For this
<Products products={products} />
```

#### 2. After that: go to the Products.jsx and change the following

- delete the following

```javascript
const products = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Beauty stuff 001",
    description: "Cremes Random",
    price: "$5",
    image: "../img/photo-1580870069867-74c57ee1bb07.jpeg",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Beauty stuff 002",
    description: "Cremes Random",
    price: "$10",
    image: "../img/photo-1608142172654-318a624fe4ec.jpeg",
  },
];
```

#### 3. Add the props here too:

```javascript
const Products = ({ products }) => {
```

<br>

#### 4. Now go to the Product.jsx

# ‚ö†Ô∏è

> You will get an error if you don't add the return:

```javascript
console.log(product);
//
return <div>test</div>;
```

#### Now lets visualize what we have, open the browser

- So that We can see the test div from above!

- We did that to check which property we are going to use, as they are not the same (the properties at the right side of the inspector, are the ones that are going to guide you)

[<img src="/src/img/props_products2.jpg"/>]()

<br>
<br>

### Now lets go back to the Product.jsx

- CHANGE A COUPLE OF STUFF (**Use the inspector**)

- You can remove the **test div** and the console log at any time,(**But add it again if you get some errors when applying the parameter in the cards, like you will see in the image below**)

<br>

##### üî¥ IN the video tutorial there are many deprecated things, this one for example didnt work for me <u>product.image.source</u>, so i had to use the console log and the div test again to check the properties, once i did that i had this: image={product.image.filename}, but it worked for all but the images, yes i solved the error but still no image, so i removed the console log and the div return, and i checked again the properties, and this time i had this: image={product.image.url}

- Check the vid in your private videos (notes to myself)

- You will see there all about this issue

```javascript
// Change this:
<CardMedia
  className={classes.media}
  image={product.image.source}
  //
  //
  // For this:
  //  image={product.image.filename}
  image={product.image.url}
/>
```

<br>

### This is how the IMG should look like now:

```javascript
const Product = ({ product }) => {
  //  styles HOOK
  const classes = useStyles();

  //
  return (
    <>

      <Card className={classes.root}>

        {/* img */}
        <CardMedia
          className={classes.media}
          image={product.image.url}
          title={product.name}
        />
```

[<img src="/src/img/img_propertie_issue_solved.jpg"/>]()

## SUCCESS ‚úîÔ∏è | We can now display the products

<br>

### Now lets solve the Html Issue in the card, its displaying html elements

- Before i forget, i also had to change this as well

```javascript
// from this:
<Typography gutterBottom variant="h5">
  {product.price}
</Typography>
//
// to this
<Typography gutterBottom variant="h5">
{product.price.formatted_with_symbol}
</Typography>

```

<br>

### Now lets solve the html issue

- REPLACE the following:

```javascript
// Description in Product.jsx
//change this
<Typography variant="body2" color="textSecondary">
  {product.description}
</Typography>
//
// __html: product you need double underscore
// For this:
          <Typography
            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: product.description }}
            variant="body2"
            color="textSecondary"
          />

```

<br>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è

## dangerouslySetInnerHTML

- Dangerously Set innerHTML,

**Improper use of the innerHTML can open you up to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.** Sanitizing user input for display is notoriously error-prone, and failure to properly sanitize is one of the leading causes of web vulnerabilities on the internet.

Our design philosophy is that it should be "easy" to make things safe, and developers should explicitly state their intent when performing ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù operations. <u>The prop name dangerouslySetInnerHTML is intentionally chosen to be frightening, and the prop value (an object instead of a string) can be used to indicate sanitized data.</u>

After fully understanding the security ramifications and properly sanitizing the data, create a new object containing only the key \_\_html and your sanitized data as the value. Here is an example using the JSX syntax:

##### [Set innerHTML vs dangerouslySetInnerHTML](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37337289/react-js-set-innerhtml-vs-dangerouslysetinnerhtml)

> The immediate effect of using innerHTML versus dangerouslySetInnerHTML is identical -- the DOM node will update with the injected HTML.

> However, behind the scenes when you use dangerouslySetInnerHTML it lets React know that the HTML inside of that component is not something it cares about.

> Because React uses a virtual DOM, when it goes to compare the diff against the actual DOM, it can straight up bypass checking the children of that node because it knows the HTML is coming from another source. So there's performance gains.

### üî¥ IF YOU GET THIS ERROR (its probably because you have no internet connection)

##### Unhandled Rejection (TypeError): Cannot read property 'status' of undefined

- in your local server you can visualize almost anything but for online databases you do need an internet connection
